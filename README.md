Avoid the bugs. When colliding with a bug, the character will lose a life and several points, and it will be reset to his initial position.
The speed of the bugs increases as the character levels up.

To increase your score, make sure to collect some gems on your way to the water.

The character gains or loses points as explained below:

|       Action        |          Score           |
|---------------------|--------------------------|
| Collide with bug    | -5                       |
| Reach water         | +(5 + character's level) |
| Collect blue gem    | +1                       |
| Collect green gem   | +2                       |
| Collect key         | +5                       |

When the character "dies" (loses his 3 lives), an end of game message will be displayed:
- character wins the game if his score is positive
- character loses the game if his score is negative
